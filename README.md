# TicTacToe

###### tags: `Python` `tkinter` `Minimax`

A simple tkinter-based TicTacToe GUI with the option for a 1 or 2 player mode.

The computer AI is built on the Minimax algorithm, with included alpha-beta pruning. 
Additional heuristics are built in to improve run-time at the larger gameboards.

Included is the option to change the gameboard from a 3x3 board up to a 10x10 board.

## Here's a quick demo video of the gameplay!

### :memo: How to start?

All you need to do is run the script titled `TicTacToe_In_Python.py`

Decide if you'll be playing against the AI or another person, what size of board you'd like to play on, and whether Player 1 will be `X` or `O`.

### On a typical 3x3 board you will be presented with this window:

### From there, roll the dice to see who goes first!

### Ties are possible and are checked for early as the board gets larger!
